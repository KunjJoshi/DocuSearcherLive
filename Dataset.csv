WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,6.0,"Dear Students, I welcome you all for our lecture series on FOOD SCIENCE & "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,7.0,"TECHNOLOGY. In today’s lecture, let’s make an attempt to know about ‘Introduction to "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,8.0,Good & Nutrition’. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,9.0, 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,10.0,INTRODUCTION of FOOD AND NUTRITION 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,11.0,"Very day, several times a day, we make food choice that influence our body’s "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,12.0,health.These choice may benefit or harm our health and over a long period the results 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,13.0,become important.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,14.0,"A proper diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,15.0,"development and to remain active. Good consumption, which largely depends on production "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,16.0,"and distribution, determines the health and nutrition status of the population. "

WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,28.0,1. BASIC TERMS USED of STUDY of FOOD AND NUTRITION:  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,0.0,,,29.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,0.0,The following terms and concepts are widely used in the understanding nutrition- 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,1.0,"Health: is defined by the World Health Organization as the “State of complete physical, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,2.0,social and mental well-being and not merely the absence of any disease and infirmity”. The 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,3.0,essential requirements of health include the following: 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,4.0,• Optical growth and development  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,5.0,• Maintenance of structural integrity and functional capacity of the body  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,6.0,• Ability to withstand the process of being with minimal loss of ability  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,7.0,"• Ability to fight diseases as shown by resisting infections,  "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,8.0,• Preventing the onset of degenerative diseases  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,9.0,• Resisting the effect of environmental pollutants and toxins 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,10.0,Goods:Products derived from plants or animals that can be taken into the body to yield 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,11.0,energy and nutrient for the maintenance of life and the growth and repair of tissues.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,12.0,"Nutrition:Nutrition is derived from gelatin word ‘nutrire’ meaning feed, nourish and is a "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,13.0,"science of foods, nutrient and other substances they contain and their actions within the body "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,14.0,"as well as social, economic, cultural and psychological associations of food and eating. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,15.0,"Nutrient: Chemical substances obtained from food and used in the body to provide energy, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,16.0,"structural materials, and regulating agents to support growth, maintenance, and repair of the "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,17.0,body’s tissues.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,18.0,Nutrient requirements:Defined as the minimum amount of the absorbed nutrient necessary 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,19.0,for normal physiological sanctioning of the body. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,20.0,Nutritional status: The health status of an individual as affected by the intakeand level of 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,21.0,nutrient and the ability of those levels to maintain normal metabolism. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,22.0,Malnutrition: means an undesirable kind of nutrition leading to ill-health. It results from a 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,23.0,"lack,excess or balance of nutrient in the diet. It includes under nutrition and "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,24.0,overnutrition.Undernutrition is a state of an insufficient supply of essential nutrient 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,25.0,andovernutrition refers to an excessive intake of one or more nutrient. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,26.0,Phytochemicals: On nutrient compounds found in plant derived foods that have biological 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,27.0,activity in the body. Goods with such phytochemicals providing benefits to health are called 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,28.0,functional foods. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,1.0,,,29.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,0.0,Balanced diet: A diet which contains different types of foods in quantities enough to meet 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,1.0,the need for nutrient as well as a small provision to meet nutrient during a short duration of 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,2.0,starvation.The daily diet must provide all essential nutrient in the required amountswhich 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,3.0,"vary with age, gender, physiological status and physical activity. A typical Indian balanced "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,4.0,"diet should provide 60-70% of energy from carbohydrates, 10-12% from protein and 20-25% "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,5.0,of energy from fat. The features of a balanced diet are- 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,6.0,• Meets nutrition requirements 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,7.0,• Develops maximum cognitive ability 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,8.0,• Prevents degenerative diseases 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,9.0,• Improves longevity 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,10.0,• Improves immunity 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,11.0,• Helps in coming up stress 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,12.0,2. NUTRIENTS   
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,13.0,Broadly the nutrient are classified based on the amount required as macronutrients and 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,14.0,"micronutrients. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein are called macronutrients because the body "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,15.0,"requires them in relatively large amounts (many grass daily). In contrast, vitamin and "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,16.0,"minerals are micronutrients, required only in small amounts (milligrams or micrograms "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,17.0,daily). 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,18.0,Carbohydrates 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,19.0,"Carbohydrates are either simple or complex, and are major sources of energy. They provide "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,20.0,"energy of 4 Cal/g. The simple carbohydrates, glucose and fructose, are found in fruits, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,21.0,"vegetables and honey, suppose in sugar and lactate in milk, while the complex "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,22.0,"polysaccharides are searches in cereals, mallets, pulses and root vegetables and glycogen in "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,23.0,animal foods. The other complex carbohydrates which are resistant to digestion in the human 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,24.0,"digestive tract are cellulose in vegetables and whole grains, and gums and sections in "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,25.0,"vegetables, fruits and cereals, which are called as the dietary fibre.  "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,26.0, 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,27.0,Protein 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,2.0,,,28.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,0.0,Proteins are complex molecule composed of different among acids. Certain among acids 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,1.0,which are termed “essential” have to be obtained from proteins in the diet since they are not 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,2.0,synthesized in the human body. Other nonessential among acids can be synthesized in the 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,3.0,body to build proteins. Proteins perform a wide range of functions and also provide energy (4 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,4.0,"Cal/g). Protein requirements vary with age, physiological status and stress and more protein "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,5.0,"is required during growth, pregnancy, lactation, infection and illness. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,6.0,"Animal foods like milk, meat, fish and eggs and plant foods such as pulses and leagues are "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,7.0,rich sources of proteins. Animal proteins are of high quality as they provide all the essential 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,8.0,"among acids in right proportions, while plant or vegetable proteins are not of the same quality "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,9.0,"because of their low content of some of the essential among acids. However, a right "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,10.0,"combination of cereals, mallets and pulses provides most of the among acids. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,11.0,At 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,12.0,"Oats are a concentrated source of energy providing 9 Cal/g, and are made up of fatty acids in "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,13.0,different proportions. Dietary fats are derived from two sources viz. the invisible fat present 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,14.0,in plant and animal foods; and the visible or added fats and oils (cooking oil). Oats serve as a 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,15.0,"vehicle for fat-double vitamin like vitamin A, D, E and K. It is necessary to have adequate "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,16.0,and good quality fat in the diet for meeting the requirements of essential fatty acids.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,17.0,"Its should include adequate amounts of fat particularly in the case of infants and children, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,18.0,to provide concentrated energy since their energy needs more compared to adults. Adults 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,19.0,"need to be cautioned to restrict intake of saturated fat (butter, thee and hydrogenated fats) "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,20.0,"and cholestrol (red meat, eggs, organ meat). Excess of these substances could lead to "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,21.0,"obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,22.0,Vitamin and Minerals 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,23.0,Vitamin are chemical compounds required by the body in small amounts. They must be 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,24.0,present in the diet as they cannot be synthesized in the body. Vitamin are essential for 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,25.0,"numerous body processes and for maintenance of the structure of skin, bone, nerves, eye, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,26.0,"brain, blood and mucous membrane. They are either water double or fat-double. Vitamin A, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,27.0,"D, E and K are fat-double, while vitamin C, and the B-complex vitamin such as thiamine "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,28.0,"(Of ),  riboflavin (Of ), niacin (Of), pyridoxine (Of), colic acid (Of) and "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,29.0,cyanocobalamin(B12 ) are watersoluble. At-double vitamin can be stored in the body while 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,30.0,water-double vitamin are not and get easily excited in urine. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,3.0,,,31.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,0.0,Minerals are organic elements found in body fluids and tissues. The important micro 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,1.0,"minerals are sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and sulphur, while zinc, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,2.0,"copper, selenium, molybdenum, flooring, coat, chromic and iodine are micro minerals. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,3.0,"They are required for maintenance and integrity of skin, hair, nails, blood and soft tissues. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,4.0,"They also govern nerve cell transmission, acid/base and fluid balance, enzyme and harmony "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,5.0,activity as well as the blood- clotting processes. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,6.0,Later–Later is a crucial element that provides the environment in which nearly all the 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,7.0,body’s activities are conducted. Several foods and large proportion of human body is made 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,8.0,up of water. It participates in many metallic reactions and supplies the medium for 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,9.0,transporting vital materials to cells and carrying waste products away from them. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,10.0,3. FOOD GROUPS  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,11.0,The balanced diet as defined earlier can be achieved through a proper blend of foods from the 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,12.0,basic five food groups based on the nutrient content and biological group the plant belongs 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,13.0,to.The five food groups are as follows- 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,14.0,"Cereal grains and products- Include foods like rice, wheat, rage, bare, maize, war, barley, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,15.0,"rice flakes, wheat flour oats etc. The main nutrient provided are Energy, protein, Invisible "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,16.0,"fat, Vitamin – Of, Vitamin – Of, Colic Acid, Iron and Fibre. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,17.0,"Pulses and Resumes- Include foods like bengal gram, black gram, green gram, red gram, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,18.0,"until (whole as well as deals) copper, peas, rajmah, soyabeans. The main nutrient provided "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,19.0,"are Energy, Protein, Invisible fat, Vitamin – Of, Vitamin – Of, Colic Acid, Calcium, Iron and "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,20.0,Fibre. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,21.0,"Silk and meat products-Include foods such as milk, cure, skilled milk, cheese, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,22.0,"paper&chicken, liver, fish, egg, meat. The main nutrient provided are Protein, At, Vitamin "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,23.0,"Of, B12, Calcium and phosphorus.  "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,24.0,"Fruits & Vegetables – Fruits include Ago, Vulva, Tomato Pipe, Zapata, Range, Sweet "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,25.0,"Time, Watermelonetc; Vegetables include green such as Amaranth, Pinch, Drumstick "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,26.0,"leaves, Coriander leaves, Mustard leaves, fenugreek leaves and other vegetables such as  "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,27.0,"Parrot, Brinjal, Ladies fingers, Capsicum, Means, Union, Drumstick, Cauliflower etc. The "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,28.0,"main nutrient provided are Vitamin C, Fibre, Invisible Oats, Carotenoids, Vitamin – Of, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,29.0,"Colic Acid, Calcium, Iron, Fibre and a variety of phytochemicals. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,4.0,,,30.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,0.0,"Oats and sugar- Utter, thee, hydrogenated oils, cooking oils like groundnut, mustard, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,1.0,"coronet, sunflower, palmoleinetc are foods under fats and sugar, jaggeryunder sugar. The "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,2.0,major nutrientsprovided are energy indifferent types of fatty acids.Oats are a concentrated 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,3.0,source of energy. Some amount of fat is needed in daily diet because they supply essential 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,4.0,"fatty acids. Besides this, some vitamin like A, D, E and K are fat double and important for "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,5.0,"our body.Sugar, dagger and honey are sweetening agents and provide carbohydrates to the "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,6.0,body. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,7.0,The five food group system has the following uses by health care professional:- 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,8.0,• Fool for nutrition assessment and screening: Valuation of dietary history of an 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,9.0,individual can disclose nutrient inadequacies from any of the five food groups. His 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,10.0,can help in identifying the risk of an individual developing malnutrition 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,11.0,• Fool for nutrition counselling: The five food group system can be used in the 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,12.0,education of an individual about proper nutrition. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,13.0,• Good levelling: The food groups can be used as a component of the food levelling. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,14.0,4. DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,15.0,The results of research studies in the field of nutrition are used by Scientists/Researchersto 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,16.0,derive standards. These standards explain the amounts of individual nutrient required by 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,17.0,healthy individuals of all age groups for supporting health. Such standards are collectively 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,18.0,called as ‘Dietary Reference Takes’ which is an umbrella term for the following individual 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,19.0,values- 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,20.0,Estimated average requirements(EAR) 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,21.0,The estimated nutrient requirement that is adequate in 50% of the population studied and is 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,22.0,used to develop the recommended dietary allowances. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,23.0,Recommended dietary allowances (RDA) 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,24.0,RDA’s are estimates of nutrient to be consumed daily to ensure the requirements of all 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,25.0,individuals in a given population. RDA is adequate for 97-98% the healthy population and 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,26.0,"is separate for physiological groups such as infants, pre-schools, children, adolescents, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,27.0,"pregnant women, lactation mothers, and adult men and women, taking into account their "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,28.0,physical activity.RDA also includes a margin of safety to cover variation between 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,29.0,"individuals, dietary traditions and practices. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,5.0,,,30.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,0.0,Adequate intake (of) 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,1.0,"For some nutrient, there is insufficient knowledge to determine an Estimated Average "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,2.0,"Requirement (which is needed to set an RDA). In these cases, an of is used which reflect the "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,3.0,average amount of a nutrient that a group of healthy people consume.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,4.0,Tolerable upper intake levels (of) 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,5.0,It is the maximum intake of a nutrient that is not associated with adverse side effects in most 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,6.0,individuals of the healthy population.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,7.0,"Overall, these recommendations apply to healthy people and may not be appropriate for "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,8.0,people with diseases who have altered nutrient needs. Are should be taken to consider 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,9.0,country specific recommendations while deciding the nutrient requirements. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,10.0,"5. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOOD, NUTRITION AND HEALTH "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,11.0,Diet has always played a vital role in supporting health. Good nutrition imparts greatly on 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,12.0,people’s general welling. Good choice influence the health and well-being of individuals. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,13.0,Malnutrition occurs when there is balance in nutrient consumed and utilized. Door 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,14.0,"nutrition can have an effect on energy levels, alertness, mobility, steaminess and healing. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,15.0,"Nutrition balance can be either:General, i.e. due to excessive/deficient amounts of food of "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,16.0,"any or all types, leading to obesity, protein energy malnutritionetcorSpecific, i.e. "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,17.0,excess/deficiency of a single nutrient that may arise due to faulty food habits or an underlying 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,18.0,"disease e.g. Vitamin C deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia etc. The health consequences "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,19.0,depend on the nutrient and the severity of the balance.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,20.0,Undernutrition is a state of nutrient deficiency due to insufficient food intake. It usually 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,21.0,"affects the balance of all the nutrient in the body. Door dies, when combined with poor "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,22.0,"health can lead to serious health andnutritional problems such as decreased immunity, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,23.0,"frequent infections, hormonechanges, diminished fat free mass, decreased work "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,24.0,"efficiency,poor growth in children, increased expenses for medical care and overall decreased "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,25.0,quality of life. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,26.0,Overnutrition is the opposite of undernutrition and occurs due to frequent or habitual 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,27.0,consumption of nutrient by eating too much food to the level that it becomes dangerous to 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,28.0,"health. Although most nutrient can be harmful in excess, the danger of overnutrition relates "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,29.0,mostly to carbohydrates and fats. Obesity is an extreme form of overnutrition resulting from 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,6.0,,,30.0,
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,0.0,an accumulation of excessive amounts of body fat. Obesity increases the risk of chronic 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,1.0,"diseases including   type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure), stroke, heart disease,   "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,2.0,"cancer, joint problems, liver problems, difficulty in breathing and decreased mobility. The "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,3.0,health consequences of these conditions range from premature death to disabilities. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,4.0,Thus with proper food choice leading to a good nutrition can have the following benefits- 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,5.0,• Promotion of optical growth and development of children 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,6.0,"• Reduced risk of developing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,7.0,"diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, iron deficiency, and dental caries (cavities). "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,8.0,• Obtaining a healthy and productive life. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,9.0,6. BMI AND NUTRITIONAL STATUS 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,10.0,"Body Pass Index (BMI) formerly called the Quetelet index, is a measure for indicating "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,11.0,nutrition status in adults. It is one of the measures used to assess an individual’s nutrition 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,12.0,status and helps to identify malnutrition. BMI is also recommended for use in children and 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,13.0,"adolescents. In children, BMI is calculated as for adults and then compared with z-scores or "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,14.0,percentiles. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,15.0,It is defined as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person’s height in 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,16.0,"metre (g/my). For example, an adult who weighs 70 g and whose height is 1.75 m will "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,17.0,have a BMI of 22.9. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,18.0,70 (g)/1.752 (my) = 22.9 g/my 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,19.0,The BMI ranges are based on the effect of excessive body fat causing disease and death. BMI 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,20.0,"was developed as an indicator of risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,21.0,"high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes because as BMI increasesthe "
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,22.0,chance of developing above mentioned diseases also increases. 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,23.0,The World Health Organization has provided the following criterion for assessment of 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,24.0,nutrition status based on BMI.  
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,25.0,BMI (g/my) 
WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,7.0,,,26.0,Nutritional status

WorkForce/FoodPDF.pdf,8.0,,,22.0,"Goods provide nutrient that are necessary forgrowth, maintenance, and repair of the body’s "

WorkForce/FoodText.txt,,,,0.0,"The spiciest of all foods is consumed by Mexican people. Their different kinds of chillies such as Jalapenos and Red Chillies are widely known to enhance spice level and taste of all the foods consumed in Mexico. Food items such as Burritoes, Tacos and Enchilladas are widely consumed with spicy sauces such as Hot Sauce, Taqueria and Tabasco. The Mexican influence on food has also been observed in developed and urban areas of America, wherein the Mexican immigrants have found their convineince in selling authentic food items from Mexico. While the rural and lesser developed areas of America might be more conservative about their food choices, the urban areas of America have welcomed their Mexican counterparts with open arms. "

WorkForce/GovtText.txt,,,,0.0,"In the latest news, The Government of India has launched a newly created scheme to facilitate the under represented communities of Northeastern India in educational institutions by the verse of Reservation. In the new bill recently passed, the government declared a 25% seat reservation in major Governmental colleges and educational institutes, such as IITs, NITs, IIITs and high schools like Kendriya Vidyalay and Jawaharlal Nehru Vidyalay. The private educational institutes are also encouraged to observe atleast 10% of seat reservation for Northeastern Indian citizens. This bill was passed to promote diversity and inclusion amongst young students and allow them to respect, appreciate and accept the Northeastern culture as one of their own. "

D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,6.0,,,21.0,pals are asked to report their degree of satisfaction with respect to their job security. A typical
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,6.0,,,22.0,“satisfaction” formulation would be: “Now satisfied are you with your present job or business in

D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,7.0,,,14.0,of individual data gathered by EUROSTAT covering often of countries in total. One decisive
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,7.0,,,15.0,advantage of the ECHP data is that there is ex ante harmonization of the questionnaire between

D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,7.0,,,19.0,satisfaction questions. Included in these latter is a question on satisfaction with job security. The
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,7.0,,,20.0,exact wording is as follows:7

D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,23.0,quantitative conclusions as the country-level mean that we are using in this paragraph.
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,24.0,10The OECD has various indicator of UIB generosity. The one that we are using takes the form of an average

D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,26.0,its failure to take into account the criterion governing eligibility for Unemployment Insurance. Since these criterion
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,27.0,"vary widely across countries, this is potentially problematical. Alternatively, we could use average of expenditures per"
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,28.0,"unemployed person, which are arguably more complete measures of UIB generosity. He choose average replacement"
D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,29.0,rates because there is a mechanical negative correlation between mean of expenditures per unemployed and the

D://Datapit Search/WorkForce/jobsec.pdf,9.0,,,31.0,below. His mechanical correlation may thus cause an artificial positive correlation between mean of expenditures

India’s law enforcement officers discussed emerging threats and steps to prevent online terrorist recruitment and radicalization with representatives from global social media companies on a regular basis.
